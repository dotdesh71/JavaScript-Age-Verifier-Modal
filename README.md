# Age Verification Modal

This project implements a dynamic age verification modal using JavaScript and Bootstrap. The modal prompts users to verify their age before accessing content intended for adults only. If the user confirms they are over 18 years old, a cookie is set to remember their choice for future visits.

## Features

- **Dynamic Modal Creation**: The modal is generated dynamically using JavaScript, eliminating the need for static HTML elements.
- **Age Verification**: Users are asked to verify their age with "Yes" or "No" options.
- **Cookie Management**: Choices are stored in cookies to remember user preferences for 30 days.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: The modal is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and modern look.

## Getting Started

To use this age verification modal in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-verification-modal.git
   cd age-verification-modal
    Open the HTML File: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

    Include Bootstrap: Ensure that you have Bootstrap included in your project. The provided code includes Bootstrap via a CDN.

Usage

    When the page loads, the age verification modal will display.
    Users can click "Yes" to confirm they are over 18 years old or "No" to indicate they are not.
    If "Yes" is clicked, the content will be displayed, and their choice will be saved in a cookie for 30 days.
    If "No" is clicked, the user will be redirected to another page (e.g., Google).
