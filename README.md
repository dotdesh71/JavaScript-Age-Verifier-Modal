# JavaScript-Age-Verifier-Modal

### Age Verification Modal Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

This project implements a dynamic age verification modal using JavaScript and Bootstrap. The modal prompts users to verify their age before accessing content intended for adults only. If the user confirms they are over 18 years old, a cookie is set to remember their choice for future visits.

## Features

- **Dynamic Modal Creation**: The modal is generated dynamically using JavaScript, eliminating the need for static HTML elements.
- **Age Verification**: Users are asked to verify their age with "Yes" or "No" options.
- **Cookie Management**: Choices are stored in cookies to remember user preferences for 30 days.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: The modal is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and modern look.

    Users can click "Yes" to confirm they are over 18 years old or "No" to indicate they are not.
